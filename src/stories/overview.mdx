# Building Stories

Use Storybook to document UI components and validate accessibility, RTL, and themes.

## Quick Start

- Run `pnpm storybook` in `osmforcities/`
- Create `*.stories.tsx` files next to your components in `src/components/`
- Export a default `meta` object and named stories using `StoryObj`
- Verify controls, RTL, and a11y panel in Storybook

## Expectations

- Cover variants, sizes, disabled state, and icon usage
- Include at least one RTL story when relevant
- Confirm zero a11y violations in the a11y panel
- Use `args` for simple cases, `render` for composed layouts

## File Placement

- Components: `src/components/**/ComponentName.tsx`
- Stories: `src/components/**/component-name.stories.tsx`
