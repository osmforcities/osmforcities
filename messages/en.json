    "description1": "OSM for Cities is an experimental platform to help people explore and follow updates from OpenStreetMap — a free, open map of the world built by volunteers. Every day, people add and improve data about streets, buildings, schools, parks, transport, and more. This project gives you a way to track those changes in places you care about.",
    "description2": "You might want to keep an eye on edits to schools in your region, or monitor how crosswalks, bus stops, or bike racks are being added to your city. Maybe you're just curious about how your neighborhood park is evolving. Whether it's a critical dataset for urban planning or something more personal and informal, the platform lets you create and follow it.",
